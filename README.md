**Weather App** is a simple weather app developed in typescript using React and NoesisGUI. The app allows you to see the weather from your current location or another location around the globe using **WeatherKit REST API**.

## Setup

```
VITE_APP_MAPKIT_BASEURL=https://maps-api.apple.com
VITE_APP_MAPKIT_TOKEN=YOUR_MAPKIT_TOKEN
VITE_APP_WEATHERKIT_BASEURL=https://weatherkit.apple.com
VITE_APP_WEATHERKIT_TOKEN=YOUR_WEATHERKIT_TOKEN
